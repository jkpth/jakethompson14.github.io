      <h2>more about me</h2>
      <p>going into college the degree of my pursuit was economics
        at the university of alabama with a full ride scholarship. it wasn't until my semester abroad in london
        during junior year that the switch to computer science ocurred. <br> <br>
        it occurred to me that my lifelong obsession with tech could actually
        be a career, and from that moment my mind was made up.<br><br>
        much of my youth was spent in scouting. the outdoors have always
        been a refuge for me and this organization taught me more about what it
        means to be a leader. <br><br>
        part of being a scout means you follow the scout law. this involves 
        certain virtues that are important to me, these include being trustworthy, loyal,
        helpful, friendly, curteous, kind, obediant, cheerful, thrifty, and brave. <br><br>
        adding me to your team means you are gaining someone who has these values and strives 
        to become a better individual every day.
